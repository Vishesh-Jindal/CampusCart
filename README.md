Project Goal

Design and developed an e-commerce application encompassing two essential services: User Service, and e-commerce. The user service will handle user authentication and registration with
different user roles. The e-commerce service will manage products, their categories, carts and orders.

Features of the User Application:
The application should allow to:
● Implement User Registration: Allow users to create an account with the required information,
such as username, email, and password.
● User Authentication and Login: Develop a secure authentication mechanism to verify user
credentials and allow them to log in to the application.
● User Roles and Permissions: Design a role-based access control system to assign users
different roles (e.g., admin, customer) and manage their permissions.
● Authorisation and Access Control: Ensure users can only access features and resources based
on their assigned roles and permissions.
● Profile Management: Enable users to view and update their profile information, such as name,
contact details, and address.
● Error Handling and Exception Management: Develop robust error handling mechanisms and
implement exception management to handle unexpected scenarios gracefully.
